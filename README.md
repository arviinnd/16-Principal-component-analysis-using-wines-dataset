Subject: use case on principal component analysis using wines dataset
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
The aim of this case study is to carry out principal component analysis for the given wines dataset. First we load the dataset and the 
libraries into the code. We then carry out data exploration activities like taking a peek at the data, studying descriptive statistics, 
class distributions and correlation between attributes. We further explore the data and then carry out data visualization using univariate
(histogram, density and box and whisker) plots and multivariate (scatter plot matrix and correlation matrix) plots. We then instantiate 
a model using PCA and then plot the two principal components as a scatter plot. Then the model is clustered using K-Means clustering. 
The clusters are then compared with the clustering carried out using K-Means algorithm before principal component analysis. The two 
models are in good agreement.
